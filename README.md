# ellipse-graph-assembly
x86 assembly program for MS-DOS that draws an ellipse, Bresenham algorithm implementation.
I used DOSBox as a x86 emulator with dos, masm assembler. 

For assembling: ./ml ELLIPSE.ASM a b, assuming masm is in path. a b are initial lengths of semiaxis. a b can be modified using arrows.
